6. Rest client:(Retrofit)
  Retrofit is REST client for android and java.It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.
  
  Using Retrofit:
  To work with Retrofit you basically need the following three classes:

- Model class which is used as a JSON model

- Interfaces that define the possible HTTP operations

- Retrofit.Builder class - Instance which uses the interface and the Builder API to allow defining the URL end point for the HTTP operations.

Every method of an interface represents one possible API call. It must have a HTTP annotation (GET, POST, DELETE,PUT etc.) to specify the request type and the relative URL. The return value wraps the response in a Call object with the type of the expected result.
